This is the (2nd version) of the landing page for the udacity's professional Web-Development course.

I provided a responsive landing page which can:

- automatically add new section with the (add a random section) button.
- automaticaaly add a link in the navigation bar to that section.
- scroll smoothly to the wanted section by clicking on it's link in the navigation bar.

It also:

- has a back to top button.
- has an active status check at which it checks which section is in view to highlight it and it's link in the navigation bar.
- declares the first 4 links to the first 4 sections automatically when page starts.

The (new sections and new links addition functions), (the on screen active status check function) and (all scrolling behaviours) are fullfilled within the (app.js) file.
The styles of the page are all within the (styles.css) file.

- These files are colcluded in their folders in the same dir. as the index.html
